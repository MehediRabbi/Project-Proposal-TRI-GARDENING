The project of creating an agriculture digitalization website with features for plant care information, selling and buying services, delivery services, and community engagement is being proposed to address the problem of lack of knowledge about plant care and to promote the benefits of indoor plants. This project aims to provide a comprehensive solution that can make a positive impact on agriculture and plant care knowledge in the country. By creating a user-friendly platform that offers valuable resources and services, the project can help users overcome the challenges of plant care and foster a sense of community around gardening. The project may also have commercial benefits for sellers and deliverymen, as it can provide a platform for them to reach a wider audience and offer their services more efficiently.
